chkconfig

The chkconfig command in Linux is used to manage services and daemons that run automatically during system startup. It allows you to enable or disable a service to start automatically at boot time. The chkconfig command reads the configuration information from the /etc/init.d directory and creates and removes the appropriate symbolic links in the /etc/rc[0-6].d directories to start or stop services.

The syntax for the chkconfig command is:

css
Copy code
chkconfig [OPTIONS] SERVICE
Here, SERVICE is the name of the service that you want to manage.

Some common options for the chkconfig command are:

--add: Add a new service to the system.
--del: Remove a service from the system.
--list: List all services and their current runlevels.
--level LEVELS: Set the runlevels for the service. LEVELS is a comma-separated list of runlevels. For example, 3,4,5 means the service will start in runlevels 3, 4, and 5.
SERVICE on: Enable a service to start automatically at boot time.
SERVICE off: Disable a service from starting automatically at boot time.
Here are some examples of how to use the chkconfig command:

To list all services and their current runlevels:
css
Copy code
chkconfig --list
This displays a list of all services and their current runlevels.

To enable a service to start automatically at boot time:
csharp
Copy code
chkconfig httpd on
This enables the httpd service to start automatically at boot time.

To disable a service from starting automatically at boot time:
vbnet
Copy code
chkconfig httpd off
This disables the httpd service from starting automatically at boot time.

Note that you need to have appropriate permissions to manage services and daemons using the chkconfig command. Typically, only the system administrator or a user with root privileges can use the chkconfig command.
