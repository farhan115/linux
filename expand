expand

The "expand" command in Linux is used to convert tabs to spaces in a file or standard input.

The basic syntax of the "expand" command is as follows:

css
Copy code
expand [options] [file]
Replace "file" with the name of the file you want to convert tabs to spaces in. If no file is specified, the command will read from standard input.

For example, to convert tabs to 4 spaces in a file named "example.txt", you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
expand -t 4 example.txt
This will convert any tabs in the file to 4 spaces.

The "expand" command also supports various options, such as "-t" to specify the number of spaces to use for each tab, "-a" to convert all spaces to tabs, and "-i" to ignore leading spaces in a line. You can use the "man expand" command to access the manual page of the command and learn more about its usage and options.
