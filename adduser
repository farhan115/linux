The adduser command in Linux is used to create a new user account. Here's how to use it:

To create a new user account with default settings:


sudo adduser username


Replace "username" with the desired username for the new account.

You will be prompted to enter and confirm a password for the new user. You can also enter additional information such as the user's full name, phone number, and other details.

If you want to specify additional options, you can use the following syntax:


sudo adduser username [options]


Replace "username" with the desired username for the new account, and replace "[options]" with any additional options you want to use. Some common options include:

--disabled-login: Creates the account but disables the user's ability to log in with a password. This is useful for system accounts that don't need a login shell.
--gecos "name,phone,other": Sets the user's full name, phone number, and other information.
--ingroup groupname: Adds the user to a specific group.
--home homedir: Sets the user's home directory.
--shell shell: Sets the user's default shell.
For example, to create a new user account with the username "johndoe", set the user's full name to "John Doe", and add them to the "users" group, you could use the following command:


sudo adduser johndoe --gecos "John Doe" --ingroup users
Note that you must have root privileges (or be a member of the sudo group) to use the adduser command.
