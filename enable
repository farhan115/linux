enable

The "enable" command in Linux is used to enable or disable shell built-in commands and functions.

The basic syntax of the "enable" command is as follows:

bash
Copy code
enable [options] name ...
Replace "name" with the name of the shell built-in command or function you want to enable or disable.

For example, to enable the "echo" command, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
enable echo
If you want to disable the "echo" command, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
enable -n echo
The "enable" command also supports various options, such as "-a" to display all enabled shell built-ins, "-f" to enable a function definition, and "-n" to disable a shell built-in. You can use the "help enable" command to display information about the usage and options of the command.
