groupdel

groupdel is a Linux command-line utility that is used to delete a group from the system. It is typically used by system administrators to manage user access to resources on a Linux system.

The basic syntax of the groupdel command is as follows:

Copy code
groupdel group_name
Here's what each part of the syntax means:

groupdel is the command name.
group_name is the name of the group you want to delete.
Here are some examples of how to use groupdel:

Delete a group named developers:

Copy code
groupdel developers
Delete a group named test:

bash
Copy code
groupdel test
Note that when you delete a group, the group's files and directories are not deleted. If you want to delete the group's files and directories as well, you will need to use a separate command, such as rm -rf /path/to/group.

Also note that deleting a group will remove all users that are currently members of the group. If you want to remove a user from a group without deleting the group, you will need to use a separate command, such as gpasswd -d username group_name.

For more information on how to use groupdel, you can refer to the manual by typing man groupdel in the terminal.
