The df command in Linux is used to display information about the disk space usage on mounted file systems. It provides a summary of the available and used space on each file system, as well as the total size of each file system.

Here is the basic syntax for the df command:

Here, directory is the directory to display the disk space information for. If no directory is specified, the df command will display information for all mounted file systems.

Here are some commonly used options for the df command:

-T: Displays the file system type for each mounted file system.
-t: Displays disk space information only for file systems of the specified type.
