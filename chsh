chsh

The chsh command in Linux is used to change a user's default login shell. The syntax for the chsh command is:

css
Copy code
chsh [OPTIONS] USERNAME
Here, USERNAME is the login name of the user whose default shell you want to change.

Some common options for the chsh command are:

-s SHELL: Set the user's default shell to SHELL.
-h: Display the help message and exit.
Here's an example of how to use the chsh command:

bash
Copy code
chsh -s /bin/zsh jsmith
This sets the default shell for the user jsmith to /bin/zsh.

Note that you need to have appropriate permissions to change a user's default login shell. Typically, only the system administrator or a user with root privileges can use the chsh command. Additionally, changing a user's default login shell may have implications for their ability to log in and use the system, so it is important to be careful when using the chsh command.
