groupmod

groupmod is a Linux command-line utility that is used to modify an existing group on the system. It is typically used by system administrators to manage user access to resources on a Linux system.

The basic syntax of the groupmod command is as follows:

css
Copy code
groupmod [options] group_name
Here's what each part of the syntax means:

groupmod is the command name.
[options] are the optional command-line options you can use with groupmod. These can include flags like -g to change the GID (group ID) of the group and -n to change the name of the group.
group_name is the name of the group you want to modify.
Here are some examples of how to use groupmod:

Change the name of a group from developers to devs:

Copy code
groupmod -n devs developers
Change the GID of a group from 500 to 501:

Copy code
groupmod -g 501 staff
Note that changing the name of a group will not affect any users that are currently members of the group. If you want to change the name of a group and update the names of all users that are members of the group, you will need to use a separate command, such as usermod -g new_group_name old_group_name.

For more information on how to use groupmod, you can refer to the manual by typing man groupmod in the terminal.
