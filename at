at

The at command in Linux is a utility that allows you to schedule a command to run at a specific time in the future. This can be useful for automating tasks or for running resource-intensive tasks during off-peak hours.

Here are some commonly used at commands:

at time: This command starts the at command-line interface, where you can specify the time at which you want a command to be executed. The time argument should be in a specific format: HH:MM, where HH is the hour in 24-hour format and MM is the minute.

at -f command-file time: This command schedules a command to be executed at the specified time, where command-file is the name of the file that contains the command you want to execute.

atq: This command lists the jobs in the at queue, along with their job numbers and scheduled execution times.

atrm job-number: This command removes a job from the at queue, where job-number is the number of the job you want to remove.

at -l: This command lists all the jobs in the at queue, along with their scheduled execution times and job numbers.

Note that at requires the atd daemon to be running, which is responsible for executing the scheduled commands. The at command is usually available on most Linux distributions by default.
