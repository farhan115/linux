The pushd command in Linux is used to change the current working directory (cwd) and simultaneously push the current directory onto a directory stack. It allows you to switch between directories while preserving the ability to return to previously visited directories easily.

Here is how you can use the pushd command:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Type pushd followed by the directory you want to navigate to. It can be an absolute path or a relative path.

bash
Copy code
pushd /path/to/directory
Press Enter. The pushd command will change the cwd to the specified directory and push the previous directory onto the directory stack.

You can continue working in the new directory, and if needed, you can use the dirs command to display the directory stack and see the order of directories stored.

To navigate back to the previous directory (top of the stack), you can use the popd command.

bash
Copy code
popd
The popd command will pop the topmost directory from the stack and change the cwd back to the previous directory.

By using the pushd and popd commands together, you can effectively navigate between directories and maintain a history of visited directories.

The directory stack operates as a last-in, first-out (LIFO) data structure. Each time you use pushd, the current directory is added to the stack, and each popd removes the topmost directory from the stack.

Please note that the directory stack is specific to the current shell session. If you open a new terminal or start a new shell session, the directory stack will not persist.

You can refer to the pushd and popd commands' manual pages (man pushd and man popd) for more information on additional options and specific usage examples.
