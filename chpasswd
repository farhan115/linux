chpasswd

The chpasswd command in Linux is used to change the passwords of user accounts in batch mode. The chpasswd command reads a list of user name and password pairs from standard input and uses them to update the password file. The syntax for the chpasswd command is:

css
Copy code
chpasswd [OPTIONS]
Some common options for the chpasswd command are:

-c METHOD: Set the password encryption method to METHOD. By default, chpasswd uses the crypt method.
-e: Encrypt the passwords using the MD5 method instead of the default crypt method.
-h: Display the help message and exit.
-s: Use a colon : as the separator between user names and passwords instead of the default whitespace.
Here's an example of how to use the chpasswd command:

Create a text file containing a list of user name and password pairs, separated by a colon ::
makefile
Copy code
user1:password1
user2:password2
user3:password3
Use the cat command to pipe the contents of the text file to the chpasswd command:
bash
Copy code
cat user-passwd.txt | chpasswd
This reads the list of user name and password pairs from user-passwd.txt and updates the password file with the new passwords.

Note that you need to have appropriate permissions to change the passwords of user accounts. Typically, only the system administrator or a user with root privileges can use the chpasswd command. Also, it is recommended to use secure methods for storing and transmitting passwords, such as using encrypted password files or protocols like SSH.
