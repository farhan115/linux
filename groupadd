Here's what each part of the syntax means:

groupadd is the command name.
[options] are the optional command-line options you can use with groupadd. These can include flags like -g to specify a GID (group ID) for the new group and -r to create a system group.
group_name is the name of the new group you want to create.
Here are some examples of how to use groupadd:
