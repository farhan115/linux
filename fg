fg

The "fg" Linux command is used to bring a job that has been stopped or sent to the background back to the foreground.

When a command is running in the foreground, it takes control of the terminal and you cannot run any other commands until it completes or is stopped. If you have started a command in the background using the "&" operator, you can bring it back to the foreground using the "fg" command.

To use the "fg" command, follow these steps:

Open a terminal window on your Linux system.
Type "jobs" to list all currently running jobs and their job numbers.
Type "fg %jobnumber" where "jobnumber" is the number of the job you want to bring back to the foreground.
For example, if the job you want to bring back to the foreground has a job number of 1, you would type "fg %1".

Once you have used the "fg" command, the job will take control of the terminal again and you can interact with it as normal.
