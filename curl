curl

The curl command in Linux is used to transfer data from or to a server using a variety of supported protocols, including HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, FTPS, SCP, SFTP, TFTP, DICT, TELNET, LDAP or FILE.

It is a versatile tool that can be used for a wide range of tasks, such as testing API endpoints, downloading files, sending HTTP requests, and more.

The basic syntax of the curl command is as follows:

curl [options] [URL]

Here, options represent various command-line options that can be used to specify how the request should be made, while URL is the URL of the server or resource to be accessed.

For example, the following command can be used to download a file from a remote server:

curl -O https://example.com/file.txt

This will download the file file.txt from the server example.com and save it to the current directory. The -O option is used to specify that the output file should be named the same as the remote file.

There are many other options that can be used with the curl command to customize its behavior, such as -X to specify the request method, -H to add headers to the request, -d to send data in the request body, and more.
