ethtool
The "ethtool" command in Linux is used to display or change the settings of Ethernet network interfaces.

The basic syntax of the "ethtool" command is as follows:

css
Copy code
ethtool [options] device
Replace "device" with the name of the Ethernet network interface you want to display or change the settings for.

For example, to display the settings of the "eth0" network interface, you can use the following command:

Copy code
ethtool eth0
This will display information such as the link speed, duplex mode, and Wake-on-LAN settings of the "eth0" interface.

If you want to change the settings of the interface, you can use various options such as "-s" to set the speed and duplex mode, "-A" to set the Wake-on-LAN settings, and "-K" to enable or disable various features such as checksum offloading and TCP segmentation offloading.

For example, to set the "eth0" interface to 100Mbps full duplex mode, you can use the following command:

sql
Copy code
ethtool -s eth0 speed 100 duplex full
The "ethtool" command also supports various other options and features, such as "-p" to blink the LED of the interface, "-t" to run cable diagnostics, and "-g" to display the ring buffer size. You can use the "man ethtool" command to access the manual page of the command and learn more about its usage and options.
