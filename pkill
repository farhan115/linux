The pkill command in Linux is used to send signals to processes based on various criteria, such as the process name, command line arguments, or user ownership. It allows you to conveniently terminate or signal processes without needing to know their specific process IDs (PIDs).

Here is the basic syntax of the pkill command:

pkill [options] pattern
To use the pkill command, follow these steps:

Open a terminal or command prompt.

Type pkill followed by the pattern you want to search for. This can be a process name, a part of the command line, or other search criteria.

Copy code
pkill firefox
or

Copy code
pkill -u username processname
Press Enter. The pkill command will search for running processes that match the specified pattern and send a signal to terminate them.
By default, pkill sends the SIGTERM signal to the matched processes, which typically initiates a graceful termination. If a process does not respond to the SIGTERM signal, you can use the -9 option to send the SIGKILL signal, which forcefully terminates the process.

The pkill command can also accept various options to customize its behavior. Some common options include:

-u username: Match processes owned by a specific user.
-x: Match the whole process name exactly.
-f: Match against the entire command line.
You can refer to the pkill command's manual page (man pkill) for more information on additional options and specific usage examples.

Please note that the pkill command may require administrative privileges to terminate processes owned by other users. Additionally, it is important to exercise caution when terminating processes, as forcefully terminating certain critical system processes can have unintended consequences.
