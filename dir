dir

In Linux, the dir command is used to display a listing of the files and directories in the current directory.

However, dir is not a standard Linux command and is typically associated with the Windows command line interface. In Linux, the ls command is used instead to display a listing of the files and directories in the current directory.

Here is the basic syntax for the ls command:

Copy code
ls [options] [directory]
Here, directory is the directory to display the file listing for. If no directory is specified, the ls command will display the file listing for the current directory.

Here are some commonly used options for the ls command:

-a: Displays all files, including hidden files.
-l: Displays a detailed listing of files and directories, including permissions, ownership, size, and modification date.
-h: Displays file sizes in human-readable format, such as "1.5G" or "10K".
-t: Sorts the files and directories by modification time.
Here are some examples of how to use the ls command:
