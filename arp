arp

The arp command in Linux is used to manipulate the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) cache. ARP is used to map a network address (such as an IP address) to a physical address (such as a MAC address). The arp command can display and modify the ARP cache on a Linux system.

Here are some commonly used arp commands:

arp: This command displays the current contents of the ARP cache.

arp -a: This command displays the current contents of the ARP cache in a more detailed format.

arp -d ip-address: This command deletes the ARP entry for the specified IP address.

arp -s ip-address mac-address: This command adds a static ARP entry to the cache. The IP address is the network address you want to map to a physical address (MAC address).

arp -n: This command displays the ARP cache without resolving hostnames.

Note that the arp command is often used in troubleshooting network connectivity issues and is useful for diagnosing problems related to ARP cache.
