Here are some commonly used bzcmp commands:

bzcmp file1.bz2 file2.bz2: This command compares the contents of the two specified compressed files file1.bz2 and file2.bz2 and prints a message indicating whether they are identical or not.

bzcmp -s file1.bz2 file2.bz2: This command suppresses the output of bzcmp and only returns the exit status, which is 0 if the files are identical, and 1 if they are not.

bzcmp --help: This command displays the help message for bzcmp, which includes a list of available options and usage examples.
