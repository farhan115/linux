ar

I'm sorry, but there is no ar command in Linux. However, there is a Linux utility called ar (short for "archive"), which is used to create, modify, and extract files from archives. It is commonly used to create static libraries.

Here are some commonly used ar commands:

ar rcs libname.a file1.o file2.o ...: This command creates a static library named libname.a from object files file1.o, file2.o, etc. The r, c, and s options respectively replace existing files, create a new archive if it doesn't exist, and writes an index into the archive.

ar t libname.a: This command lists the contents of the archive libname.a.

ar x libname.a: This command extracts all files from the archive libname.a into the current directory.

ar d libname.a file.o: This command deletes the file file.o from the archive libname.a.

Note that ar is a low-level tool, and its use is usually reserved for developers or advanced users.
