bind

The bind command in Linux is used to display and modify the key bindings (keyboard shortcuts) used by the readline library, which is used by many programs in the Linux terminal environment. It is a command-line tool that can be used to customize the keyboard shortcuts used by the shell and other programs.

Here are some commonly used bind commands:

bind -P: This command lists all of the currently defined key bindings and their associated commands.

bind -l: This command lists all of the currently defined key bindings in a format that is suitable for use with the bind command.

bind keyseq:function-name: This command binds the specified keyseq (a sequence of keys or a single key) to the specified function-name. For example, bind "\C-a":beginning-of-line binds the Ctrl-a key sequence to the beginning-of-line function, which moves the cursor to the beginning of the current line.

bind -r keyseq: This command removes the binding for the specified keyseq. For example, bind -r "\C-a" removes the binding for the Ctrl-a key sequence.

bind -x keyseq:shell-command: This command binds the specified keyseq to the specified shell-command. When the key sequence is pressed, the shell command will be executed in a new shell. For example, bind -x "\C-t":"ls -l" executes the ls -l command when the Ctrl-t key sequence is pressed.

Note that bind is a powerful tool that can be used to customize the keyboard shortcuts used by the shell and other programs. However, it can also be dangerous if used improperly, so it is important to be careful when modifying key bindings.
