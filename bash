bash

bash is the default shell (command-line interface) in most Linux distributions, including Ubuntu. It is an acronym for "Bourne-Again SHell", as it is a free and open-source implementation of the original Bourne shell (sh) with additional features and enhancements.

Here are some commonly used bash commands:

cd directory: This command changes the current working directory to directory.

ls: This command lists the files and directories in the current working directory.

mkdir directory: This command creates a new directory with the specified directory name.

touch filename: This command creates a new file with the specified filename.

cp source-file destination-file: This command copies the source-file to destination-file.

mv source-file destination-file: This command moves or renames the source-file to destination-file.

rm filename: This command removes the specified filename.

echo "text": This command displays the specified text on the terminal.

cat filename: This command displays the contents of the specified filename.

grep pattern filename: This command searches for lines in the specified filename that match the specified pattern.

man command: This command displays the manual page for the specified command.

Note that bash also supports variables, loops, conditional statements, functions, and other programming constructs, which makes it a powerful scripting language for automating tasks and processing data.
