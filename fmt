fmt

The "fmt" Linux command is used to format text files by reflowing lines and adjusting line breaks based on specified parameters.

The basic syntax of the "fmt" command is as follows:

css
Copy code
fmt [options] [filename]
Here, "filename" is the name of the text file you want to format. If "filename" is not specified, "fmt" will read from standard input.

Some common options for the "fmt" command include:

"-w n" : Set the maximum line width to "n" characters.
"-s" : Split long lines at sentence boundaries.
"-t" : Indent the first line of each paragraph.
"-u" : Leave underline characters in the text and treat them as bold.
Here are some examples of using the "fmt" command:

To reformat a text file named "example.txt" to have a maximum line width of 80 characters:
bash
Copy code
fmt -w 80 example.txt
This reformats the text in "example.txt" to have lines no longer than 80 characters.

To reformat a text file named "example.txt" to indent the first line of each paragraph and split long lines at sentence boundaries:
bash
Copy code
fmt -t -s example.txt
This reformats the text in "example.txt" to have an indented first line for each paragraph and to split long lines at the end of sentences.

Note that the "fmt" command is a useful tool for formatting text files, but it may not always produce the desired output for more complex formatting needs.
