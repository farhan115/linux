echo

The "echo" command in Linux is used to display a message or a value of a variable on the standard output.

For example, to display the message "Hello, World!" on the terminal, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
echo "Hello, World!"
If you want to display the value of a variable, you can use the following syntax:

bash
Copy code
echo $VARIABLE_NAME
Replace "VARIABLE_NAME" with the name of the variable you want to display. For example, if you have a variable named "MY_NAME" and you want to display its value, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
MY_NAME="John Doe"
echo $MY_NAME
This will display the value "John Doe" on the terminal.
