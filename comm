comm

The comm command is a Linux utility that compares two sorted files line by line and writes three columns to the standard output: lines only in file 1, lines only in file 2, and lines in both files.

Here's the basic syntax of the comm command:

comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2

Here are some common options:

-1: Suppress printing of column 1 (lines unique to FILE1).
-2: Suppress printing of column 2 (lines unique to FILE2).
-3: Suppress printing of column 3 (lines that appear in both files).
-i: Ignore case differences when comparing lines.
-u: Suppress printing of lines that appear in both files.
-z: Use nulls, rather than newlines, to separate lines.
Here's an example usage of the comm command:

$ cat file1.txt
apple
banana
grape
orange
$ cat file2.txt
banana
grapefruit
orange
pineapple
$ comm file1.txt file2.txt
		apple
		grape
		banana
grapefruit
pineapple
