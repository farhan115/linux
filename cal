cal

The cal command in Linux is used to display a calendar on the terminal. By default, it displays the current month's calendar, but you can also specify a month and year to display a specific month's calendar.

Here are some commonly used cal commands:

cal: This command displays the current month's calendar on the terminal.

cal -m month year: This command displays the calendar for the specified month and year.

cal -y year: This command displays a calendar for the entire year.

cal -3: This command displays the current month's calendar along with the previous and next month's calendars.

cal --help: This command displays the help message for cal, which includes a list of available options and usage examples.

Note that cal is a simple command-line tool that is useful for quickly viewing a calendar on the terminal. It can be used to plan and schedule events, or to check the date for a specific day or month.
