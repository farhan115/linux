eject

The "eject" command in Linux is used to eject removable media such as CDs, DVDs, and USB drives from the system.

The basic syntax of the "eject" command is as follows:

css
Copy code
eject [options] [device]
Replace "device" with the name of the device you want to eject. If you don't specify a device name, the command will eject the default device (usually the CD/DVD drive).

For example, to eject a CD from the default device, you can use the following command:

Copy code
eject
If you want to eject a specific device (e.g., /dev/sr0), you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
eject /dev/sr0
The "eject" command also supports various options, such as "-T" to close the tray after ejecting, "-s" to prevent the device from spinning up when ejected, and "-p" to eject the media from a SCSI device. You can use the "man eject" command to access the manual page of the command and learn more about its usage and options.
