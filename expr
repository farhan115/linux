expr

The "expr" command in Linux is used to evaluate expressions and perform arithmetic operations.

The basic syntax of the "expr" command is as follows:

bash
Copy code
expr [options] expression
Replace "expression" with the arithmetic expression you want to evaluate. The expression can contain integers, arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %), and parentheses for grouping.

For example, to add two numbers (5 and 3), you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
expr 5 + 3
This will display the result "8" on the terminal.

The "expr" command also supports various options, such as "-i" to treat the input as octal (base 8), "-f" to treat the input as floating-point numbers, and "-x" to treat the input as hexadecimal (base 16). You can use the "man expr" command to access the manual page of the command and learn more about its usage and options.

Note that the "expr" command is mainly used in shell scripts for performing arithmetic operations and evaluating expressions. However, modern shells such as Bash have built-in arithmetic capabilities and do not require the use of the "expr" command for basic arithmetic operations.
