The addgroup command in Linux is used to create a new group. Here's how to use it:

To create a new group, use the following command:


sudo addgroup groupname
Replace "groupname" with the desired name of the new group.

This will create a new group with the specified name.

You can also specify additional options using the following syntax:


sudo addgroup groupname [options]
Replace "groupname" with the desired name of the new group, and replace "[options]" with any additional options you want to use. Some common options include:

--gid gid: Sets the group ID of the new group.
--system: Creates a system group (with a GID < 1000).
--force-badname: Allows the use of group names that don't conform to naming conventions.
For example, to create a new system group with the name "mygroup", you could use the following command:


sudo addgroup --system mygroup
Note that you must have root privileges (or be a member of the sudo group) to use the addgroup command. The sudo command is used to run the addgroup command with elevated privileges. If you're running this command in a script, you may need to enter your password when prompted.
