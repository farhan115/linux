cd

The cd command is a Linux command used to change the current working directory of the terminal session.

Syntax:

bash
Copy code
cd [directory_path]
Example usage:

bash
Copy code
cd /home/user/documents/
This command will change the current working directory to /home/user/documents/.

If no argument is provided, cd changes the current working directory to the user's home directory.

Options:

-: changes the current directory to the previous working directory.
..: moves the current directory up one level in the directory tree.
.: represents the current directory (used to specify the current directory in pathnames).
~: represents the user's home directory (used to specify the home directory in pathnames).
Note that the cd command only affects the current terminal session. If you open a new terminal session, the working directory will be the default home directory for the user.
