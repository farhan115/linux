compress

The compress command is a legacy command used in Linux to compress files. It is a file compression utility that compresses files using the Lempel-Ziv-Welch (LZW) algorithm.

Here's the basic syntax of the compress command:
compress [OPTIONS] [FILE_NAME]

The options that can be used with the compress command are:

-c : Writes the compressed output to stdout instead of a file.
-f : Forces compression of the file, even if it is a hard link or a symbolic link.
-r : Recursively compresses the files in the specified directory and its subdirectories.
-v : Displays the name of the file being compressed and the percentage of compression achieved.
For example, to compress a file named "file.txt", you can use the following command:

compress file.txt

This will create a compressed file named "file.txt.Z" in the same directory.

To decompress a file, you can use the uncompress command:

uncompress file.txt.Z

This will decompress the compressed file and create a file named "file.txt" in the same directory.
