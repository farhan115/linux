date

The date command in Linux is used to display or set the system date and time.

To display the current date and time, simply enter the following command in the terminal:

date
This will display the date and time in the default format for your system.

To display the date and time in a specific format, you can use the + operator followed by the format string. For example, to display the date and time in the format of "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS", you can use the following command:

date +'%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
To set the system date and time, you need to have root or superuser privileges. The general syntax for setting the date and time is:

date -s "yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss"
For example, to set the date and time to April 13, 2023, 3:30 PM, you can use the following command:

sudo date -s "2023-04-13 15:30:00"
Note that the sudo command is used to run the date command with superuser privileges.
