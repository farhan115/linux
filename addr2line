The addr2line command in Linux can be used to convert memory addresses to file names and line numbers. This can be useful for debugging programs that have crashed or generated a core dump.

Here's how to use addr2line:

Compile your program with debugging symbols. This is usually done by passing the -g option to your compiler.

Generate a core dump of your program (if it has crashed). This can be done using the gcore command or by sending the SIGABRT signal to your program.

Run addr2line with the memory address you want to look up. For example, to look up the file name and line number for the address 0x4005a0, use the following command:


addr2line -e <program> 0x4005a0
Replace <program> with the name of your program's executable file.

addr2line will output the file name and line number corresponding to the memory address you provided. If the address corresponds to a function, addr2line will also output the name of the function.

Note that addr2line may not always be able to resolve memory addresses to file names and line numbers, particularly if your program has been optimized or stripped of debugging symbols.
